## Notes

This dataset features a 150-items concept list (concepticon link [here](https://concepticon.clld.org/contributions/Heggarty-2005-150)) for languages of three andean families, Quechua, Aymara and Uru-Chipaya. In the current version, the dataset features 42 Quechua varieties, three of those from colonial times, five Aymara languages and three languages of the Uru-Chipaya family. The data is collected from a variety of published sources as well as a couple of individual contributions. All forms have been converted to IPA and segmentated to enable further processing for both traditional and computational research. Even so, the phonological data is to be taken with caution, as no own fieldwork was involved and the phonological information varies hugely from source to source. We greatly appreciate any improvement on gaps in our dataset as well as additional phonological information.

Furthermore, this dataset is part of an ongoing research project which searches to re-evaluate the internal classification of Quechua and was first presented at a talk during the RE(E)LA conference in September 2021. A journal article on this topic is accepted for publication in *Indiana* mid-2023.
